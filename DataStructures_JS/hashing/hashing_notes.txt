Hashing is a common technique for storing data in such a way that the data can be 
inserted and retrieved very quickly. It uses a data structure called a Hash Table.
Hashes perform poorly on operations involving searching, such as finding the 
minimum and maximum value in a data set. For these operations, other data structures
such as the binary search tree are more appropriate.

The Hash table data structure is designed around an array.
The choice of a hashing function depends on the data type of the key. If your key is an integer
then the simplest hash function is to return the key modulo the size of the array.

There are circumstances when this function is not recommended, such as when the keys all end in 0
and the array size is 10. This is one reason the array size should always be a prime number.

If the keys are random integers, then the hash function should more evenly distribute the keys.
This type of hashing is known as modular hashing.
