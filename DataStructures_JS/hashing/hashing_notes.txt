Hashing is a common technique for storing data in such a way that the data can be 
inserted and retrieved very quickly. It uses a data structure called a Hash Table.
Hashes perform poorly on operations involving searching, such as finding the 
minimum and maximum value in a data set. For these operations, other data structures
such as the binary search tree are more appropriate.

The Hash table data structure is designed around an array.
